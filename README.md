# Interactive Navigation Menu

This project demonstrates an interactive navigation menu that changes color or style when scrolling down or when hovering over a menu item. The navigation menu has a fixed position and is visible on all pages. It uses HTML to structure the menu, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to add interactivity.

## Features

- Fixed position navigation menu.
- Changes background color when scrolling.
- Smooth scroll to sections when clicking on navigation items.
- Each section occupies the full viewport height.

## Files

- `task1.html`: Contains the HTML structure.
- `style.css`: Contains the CSS styling.
- `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript for interactivity.
